# DesignTwoProportions

This repository contains R code associated with the article titled "Are the Tests Overpowered or Underpowered? A Unified Solution to Correctly Specify Type I Errors in the Design of Clinical Trials for Two Sample Proportions." This article was published in *Statistics in Medicine*. 

The codes aid in the design of two-sample proportion tests using precise calculations. The repository includes two folders: one contains the functions for the proposed methodology, and the other houses the simulations used in the article.

## Function Folder
There are seven code pieces consisitng the implementation of the methodology.
